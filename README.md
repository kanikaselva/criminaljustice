Judgment by Algorithm: Exploring AI Fairness in Criminal Justice

# Judgment by Algorithm: Exploring AI Fairness in Criminal Justice

##### *An evaluation of the use of AI in criminal justice, focusing on fairness and bias in algorithmic vs. human decisions across three counties with distinct demographic profiles*

Analysis is performed for each County separately and a combined analysis of all three counties. The types of analysis performed includes:

1. **Analyze the demographic profiles:** Evaluate and visualize the demographic characteristics (race, gender, and education) for each county using Pandas (Python).
2. **Evaluate risk scores across demographic groups:** Analyze the distribution of risk scores by race and gender within each county.
3. **Compare judges’ bail decisions to AI risk scores:** Investigate the alignment between judges’ bail decisions and AI-generated risk scores across different racial and gender groups.
4. **Analyze re-offense rates and fairness metrics:** Calculate re-offense rates and key fairness metrics, including False Positive Rate (FPR) and False Negative Rate (FNR), for each racial group.
